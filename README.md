# SuperCharacterApp
##The application mimics sort of RPG game.

**Currently CRUD operations implemented only.**

Repository pattern with Unit of Work.

*Used 3rd party libraries and other technology stack information:

   > ASP.NET CORE v2.2
   
   > EF Core

* X.PagedList - Used for pagination -> https://github.com/dncuug/X.PagedList
* Shouldly - Used in my unit tests  -> [https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly]
* AutoMapper - used to map DTO to models and vice versa -> [https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper]
* XUnit - framework for unit testing -> [https://xunit.github.io/]


Used InMemory Db instead mocking for the unit tests.
